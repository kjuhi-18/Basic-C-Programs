## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

* ✔️ How characters are stored internally using ASCII values
* ✔️ How to transform characters (uppercase ↔ lowercase, digits, symbols)
* ✔️ Using `if–else` conditions effectively
* ✔️ Working with character input in C

---

## 📄 Program Overview (`code.c`)

This program performs **character-level transformations** based on the input.

### ✨ Common Transformations Covered

* Convert **lowercase to uppercase**
* Convert **uppercase to lowercase**
* Identify **digits, alphabets, and special characters**
* Demonstrate ASCII-based character manipulation

> 💡 The logic is built using simple conditions so beginners can easily understand.

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

### 1️⃣ Compile

```bash
gcc code.c -o transform
```

### 2️⃣ Execute

```bash
./transform
```

## 🧪 Sample Input / Output

**Input:**

```
Enter a character: a
```

**Output:**

```
Uppercase equivalent: A
```

---

**Input:**

```
Enter a character: Z
```

**Output:**

```
Lowercase equivalent: z
```

## 🔢 ASCII Insight (Beginner Tip)

| Character | ASCII Value |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `A`       | 65          |
| `Z`       | 90          |
| `a`       | 97          |
| `z`       | 122         |

📌 Difference between lowercase & uppercase letters = **32**

---

## 🌱 Beginner Tips

* ✨ Remember: characters are stored as numbers (ASCII)
* ✨ Always check character range before converting
* ✨ Practice by modifying the program for strings
* ✨ Try handling multiple characters using loops

---

## 📌 Suggested Enhancements

* Convert **entire strings** instead of one character
* Add menu-based transformation options
* Handle whitespace and special symbols
* Use `ctype.h` functions like `toupper()` and `tolower()`
